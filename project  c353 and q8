Consider the following database
Project(project_id,proj_name,chief_arch) , project_id is primary key
Employee(Emp_id,Emp_name) , Emp_id is primary key
Assigned-To(Project_id,Emp_id)
create table Project(project_id varchar(10),proj_name varchar(20),chief_arch varchar(20));

create table Employee(Emp_id int,Emp_name varchar(20));

alter table Project add primary key(project_id);

alter table Emp add primary key(Emp_id);

create table Assigned_To(project_id varchar(5),Emp_id int ,project_id int, foreign key(project_id) references Project(project_id), Emp_id int , foreign key (Emp_id) references Employee(Emp_id) );

insert into Project Values('C353','Database','MYSQL'),('C354','JAVA','Ecplise'),('C453','PYTHON','Pycharm');

insert into Employee Values(123,'Swapnil'),(124,'Akshay'),(125,'Ritul');

insert into Assigned_To values('C353',123),('C353',124),('C354',125);

1.Get the details of employees working on project C353
select emp_id from Assigned_To where projectid = 'C353';

2. Get employee number of employees working on project C353
select A.emp_id, emp_name from Assigned_To A , Employee where project_id = 'C353' ;
//select count(*) from Assigned_To  , Employee where project_id = 'C353' ;

3. Obtain details of employees working on Database project
select Emp_name, A. Emp_id from A. Assigned_To A, Employee where project_id in (select P.project_id from P. project where P. proj_name = 'Database');

4. Get details of employees working on both C353 and C354
select Emp_name, A.emp_id from Assigned_to A, Employee where A.Project_id = 'C354' union select Emp_name, A.emp_id from Assigned_to A, Employee where A.Project_id = 'C353';

5. Get employee numbers of employees who do not work on project C453
select emp_name from assigned_to a, employee where project_id <> 'c453';

Consider the following database
Employee(emp_no,name,skill,pay-rate) eno primary key
Position(posting_no,skill) posting_no primary key
Duty_allocation(posting_no,emp_no,day,shift)
Find the SQL queries for the following:

create table Employee(emp_no int, primary key(emp_no),name text,skill text,pay_rate int);

create table Positions(posting_no int, primary key(posting_no),skill text);

create table Duty_allocation(posting_no int ,foreign key(posting_no) references Positions(posting_no),emp_no int ,foreign key(emp_no) references Employee(emp_no),day date,shift text);

1. Get the duty allocation details for emp_no 123461 for the month of April 1986.
select posting_no., shift, day
from Duty_allocation
where emp_no = 123461 and
Day ≥ 1986-04-01 and Day ≤ 1986-04-30 ;

2. Find the shift details for Employee ‘xyz’
select posting_no., shift, day
from Duty_allocation, Employee
where Duty allocation.emp_no. = Employee.emp_no and
Name = 'XYZ';

3. Get employees whose rate of pay is more than or equal to the rate of pay of employee ‘xyz’
select S.name, S.pay_rate from Employee as S, Employee as T where S.pay_rate > T.pay_rate and T.name = 'XYZ';

4. Get the names and pay rates of employees with emp_no less than 123460 whose rate of pay is more than the rate of pay of at least one employee with emp_no greater than or equal to 123460.
Select name, pay_rate  from Employee where emp_no < 123460 and pay_rate > some (select pay_rate from Employee where emp_no ≥ 123460);

5. Find the names of employees who are assigned to all positions that require a Chef’s skill
select S.Name from Employee S where (select posting_no from Duty_allocation D where S.emp_no = D.emp_no) contains (select P.posting_no from position P where P.skill = 'Chef');

6 .Find the employees with the lowest pay rate
select emp_no, Name, Pay_rate from Employee where pay_rate ≤ all (select pay_rate from Employee)

7 .Get the employee numbers of all employees working on at least two dates.
select emp_no from Duty_allocation group by emp_no having (count;*) > 1

8 .Get a list of names of employees with the skill of Chef who are assigned a duty
select Name from Employee where emp_no in ((select emp_no from Employee where skill = 'Chef') intersect (select emp_no from Duty_allocation));

9 .Get a list of employees not assigned a duty
(select emp_no from Employee) minus (select emp_no from Duty_allocation)

10.Get a count of different employees on each shift
select shift, count (distinct emp_no) from Duty_allocation group by shift;
